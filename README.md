An enhanced "Python - Directory Archiver". "Stumbles" through a given path and it's sub-directories, creates a persistent dictionary archive and simultaneously keeps a database up to date with changes. Perfect for file servers with a web-interface. Can link to download scripts (examples coming soon).


Ignore - (these files are unique to you)

filesdict.p  <- the pickled archive of file data. this file is created in whatever directory the main script is stored in.

extensions.p <- the pickled archive of file extensions. "
